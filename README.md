# Surfs_Up

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to give W. Avy some more information about temperature trends in Oahu. Specifically, W. Avy wants the temperature data for the months of June and December to determine if his business idea of a surf and ice cream shop will be sustainable all year.

## Results

Three key differences between the June and December temperature data are:
1. The mean temperature in June (mean = 74.94 degrees Fahrenheit(F)) is 3.9 degrees F higher than the temperature of December at 71.04 degrees F.
2. The median temperature in June is 75.00 degrees F, which is 4.00 degrees F higher than the December value of 71.00 degrees F.
3. The minimum temperature recorded in June was 64.00 degrees F and 56.00 degrees F in December, which is a difference of 8.00 degrees F. 

## Summary

As expected, all comparisons regarding crucial temperature parameters (mean, median, maximum, minimum) between June and December all show higher values in June. Further analyses regarding the temperature data show that the temperature is recorded to be higher than 70 degrees F 94.76 % of the time in June and 68.29 % of the time in December. Also, there seems to be more precipitation in the month of June (927 recordings) than December (895 recordings). These statistics will help further investigate the likelihood that precipitation or low temperatures will drive customers away from the business and determine the feasibly of W. Avy's business idea.
